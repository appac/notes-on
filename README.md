# Notes On Web Dev

This repo is an incomplete catalogue of notes I've taken on web development. The notes vary in scope, quality, value, and difficulty, and are not intended to be any kind of curriculum (or defacto source of reliable information. Many are succinct re-writes of existing articles or information sources.

If you find any note is lacking, or incorrect, please feel free to submit an issue.
